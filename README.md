AI-generated content (summaries, replies, action items) may be inaccurate or incomplete and **must always be reviewed before sending**. See the [full disclaimer](#disclaimer) below.

### 1. Download the extension

Click the green **Code** button on this page and choose **Download ZIP**, then unzip the folder.

Or if you use Git:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/isw-kudos/huddo-ai-assistant-for-verse.git
```

### 2. Load into Chrome or Firefox

#### Chrome



1. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions`

> **Note:** Temporary add-ons are removed on restart. For a permanent install, the extension must be signed and published on [addons.mozilla.org](https://addons.mozilla.org).

2. Open Terminal and pull a model:
   ```bash
   ollama pull llama3
   ```
3. Ollama starts automatically at `http://localhost:11434`
4. In the extension settings, select **Ollama**, enter the model name (`llama3`), and save

Other good models to try: `mistral`, `phi3`, `gemma3`  
Full model list: [ollama.com/library](https://ollama.com/library)
